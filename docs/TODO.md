[DONE] Demo mode
[TODO] ETA: 26m 46s - seems miscalculated, based only on speed of already compressed files, not on remaining file count/size to compress
[TODO] F key: dedicated in/out folder stats (file count, size, % compressed, number of uncompressed for different reasons - total, RW status, whether a mask exists, whether dedicated folders are provided)
[RESOLVED] Investigate why the ACTIVE JOBS progress bar sometimes starts at the beginning of the line instead of the indent like most. Random occurrences, no clear reason / wrap lines, widen or narrow terminal to observe/
[TODO] Keep an in-session list of files like "File is corrupted (ffprobe failed to read). Skipped.", show only those files as list entries / add pagination, 10 files per page, name, size, location, error
